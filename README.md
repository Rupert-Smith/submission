# Retail Customer Mobile Solution

## Important - **PLEASE READ**

### Supporting Document

To support my work on the front-end, I have created a **supporting Figma document**. I would advise taking a look at this document first, as it will help illustrate my thought process and approach to the project.

### Mobile First

Please be aware that this is a **mobile-first solution**. When running the application, it is highly recommended to view it with dimensions associated with a mobile device (320 - 425px) for the best user experience. This can be achieved on Chrome, for example, by utilizing DevTools and clicking the **"Toggle Device Toolbar"** button.

### Confidentiality

Please be aware that I have replaced all references to "C\*\*\*on" with "Company" in this README file.

## Thoughts and Comments

I greatly enjoyed this challenge! There is a lot to talk about, and I look forward to our discussion on Tuesday. I spent a great deal of time planning to ensure a meaningful solution. I found market research, along with general research and UX, was key.

Thank you for your consideration!
